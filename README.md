# Single-Cycle-MIPS

Microprocessor without Interlocked Pipeline Stages (MIPS) is a widely used instruction set architecture. In this project, weâ€™re going to implement the single-cycle MIPS architecture using Verilog. This processor supports floating point and double instructions as well.

## Instruction Set
The instructions supported are listed as follows:
* Original Instructions
| Instruction | Type | Opcode | Funct |
| ----------- | ---- | ------ | ----- | 
| sll | R | 0 | 00 |
| srl | R | 0 | 02 |


add | R | 0 | 20
sub | R | 0 | 22
and | R | 0 | 24
or | R | 0 | 25
slt | R | 0 | 2A
addi | I | 8 | N/A
lw | I | 23 | N/A
sw | I | 2B | N/A
beq | I | 4 | N/A
bne | I | 5 | N/A
j | J | 2 | N/A
jal | J | 3 | N/A
jr | R | 0 | 8

* Floating Point Unit (FPU) Instructions
Instruction | Type | Opcode | Funct
----------- | ---- | ------ | -----
