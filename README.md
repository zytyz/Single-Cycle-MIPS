# Single-Cycle-MIPS

Microprocessor without Interlocked Pipeline Stages (MIPS) is a widely used instruction set architecture. In this project, weâ€™re going to implement the single-cycle MIPS architecture using Verilog. This processor supports floating point and double instructions as well.

### Instructions
The instructions supported are listed as follows:
Instruction | Type | Opcode | Funct
----------- | ---- | ------ | -----
sll | R | 0 | 00
